## ðŸ“– Research

I reviewed several leading AI platforms and noted their standout features:

1. **ChatGPT & ClaudeAI**  
   Clean interface , minimalistic design, easy model selection.

2. **Hugging Face Spaces**  
   Community-driven demos with their product suite.

3. **Google Gemini Image Generation**  
   Offers seamless multimodal support with high-quality text-to-image generation directly in the interface.

### âœ¨ Chosen Features to Combine
From these platforms, I selected **6 core features** to implement in my design:
1. **Model Selector** â€“ choose between models.  
2. **Prompt Editor** â€“ save/load prompts from mock data.  
3. **Parameters Panel** â€“ sliders/inputs for previous chats , dashboard , image creation etc.  
4. **Chat/Output Area** â€“ user/AI conversation, with copy & download JSON actions.  
5. **Responsive Layout** â€“ works across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
6. **Animations:** Framer Motion transitions + Lenis smooth scroll.  


ðŸ‘‰ Note: *The "Stories" section was new to me, so I didnâ€™t go very deep into it, but I included initial setups and examples. I will update this section as I learn more.*

## ðŸ“± Extra Notes
- Responsiveness tested across multiple breakpoints.  
- Added **Framer Motion animations** and **Lenis smooth scroll** for polish.  
- Added **floating navbar** for easy navigation.
- Added **chatbot** so you get to know more about me.

### If I Had More Time
- Improve **mobile-first design** polish.  
- Refine **typography hierarchy** for better readability.  
- Add **dynamic chat functionality** with mock-apis.
- Integrate **dual theme**.
