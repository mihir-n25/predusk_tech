# 🚀 Frontend Developer Assignment - Mihir Nebani - Deadline 23 August 2025

This project is a **pixel-perfect homepage clone** built as part of the Z1 Tech Frontend Developer assignment.  
I chose **PostLabs** and focused on delivering high-quality UI, animations, and responsiveness.  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – For optimized, scalable React framework with SSR support  
- **TailwindCSS** – For utility-first, responsive styling  
- **Framer Motion** – For smooth, performant animations and transitions  
- **Lenis** – For smooth scrolling experience  

---

## 🛠️ Animation Approach
To achieve precise animations, I followed a **step-by-step breakdown**:
1. Built the **outer container components** first.  
2. Gradually refined into **smaller components with exact animations**.  
3. Used **experience from practice sessions** to replicate some animations.

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions
- **Exact Typography & Pixel-Perfect Match** → Solved by using browser DevTools and font inspection tools to extract correct font weights, spacing, and sizes.  
- **Animations & Timing** → Some animations were tricky; breaking them into smaller components made it easier to replicate.  
- **Responsiveness** → Used a mobile-first approach with Tailwind’s breakpoint utilities to ensure layouts adapted correctly.  
- **Time Constraint (48 hrs)** → Balanced between visual accuracy and performance while prioritizing key features.  

---

## ⏱️ Time Breakdown
- **Day 1**:  
  - Built full structure and layout (~50% similarity achieved).  
  - Focused on flow and sectioning without pixel perfection.  
- **Day 2**:  
  - Optimized every component.  
  - Improved **animations, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility**.  
  - Added enhancements (footer, chatbot, smooth scroll).  

---

## 🚀 If I Had One More Day
- Optimize all **images with compression** for faster load times.  
- Improve **text animations** across sections for more fluidity.  
- Polish font alignment and achieve **closer to 100% accuracy**.  
- Add micro-interactions for enhanced UX.  

---

## 📂 Additional Enhancements
- **Sticky Footer** → For better contrast and consistent visibility.  
- **Chatbot Integration** → Showcasing ability to extend features.
